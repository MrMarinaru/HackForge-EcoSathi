This project uses supervised machine learning to automatically classify and segregate waste into categories such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, and organics. By reducing contamination in recycling streams, it improves efficiency, sustainability, and scalability of waste management.

Problem Statements
1.Municipal bodies often misclassify recyclables, causing improper disposal.
2.Lack of community platforms limits waste exchange and recycling participation.
3.Poor recycling incentives reduce motivation for households and businesses.

Solutions
1.Integrate with recycling centers using supervised learning (Random Forest) for precise waste classification.
2.Provide a user-friendly web platform for easy scheduling of recyclable pickups and drop-offs.
3.Implement points-based gamification with reinforcement learning to personalize rewards.
4.Use APIs for secure digital wallet integration and seamless reward redemption.
