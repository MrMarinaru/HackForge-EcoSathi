# HackForge-EcoSathi
This project uses supervised machine learning to automatically classify and segregate waste into categories such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, and organics. By reducing contamination in recycling streams, it improves efficiency, sustainability, and scalability of waste management.

# Problem Statements
1. Municipal bodies often misclassify recyclables, leading to improper disposal and increased contamination.  
2. The absence of community platforms limits opportunities for waste exchange and reduces participation in recycling programs.  
3. Insufficient recycling incentives lower motivation for households and businesses to segregate waste effectively.

# Solutions
1. Integration with recycling centers using supervised machine learning (Random Forest classifier) for accurate and automated waste classification.  
2. A user-friendly web platform that enables easy scheduling of recyclable pickups and drop-offs for enhanced convenience.  
3. A points-based gamification system powered by reinforcement learning to deliver personalized recycling rewards and boost user engagement.  
4. Secure API integration with digital wallets for seamless reward management and redemption.
